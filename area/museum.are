dracoliche dragon exhibit~
a {Dd{xr{ma{xc{Do{xl{mi{xc{mh{De{x~
An ancient {Dd{xr{ma{xc{Do{xl{mi{xc{mh{De{x of unbelieveable size occupies the bulk of this exhibit.
~
More than a powerful form of undead a dracolich is a dragon who has
voluntarily tied its soul to a phylactery, freeing itself from death. A type
of lich, the creature's spirit can possess any dead serpentine body, usually
their original form, and retain all the powers and abilities of the former
body. That means a dracolich has the supernatural fear aura, spells, and
breath weapon it had in life, plus the terrible might of the undead.
 
A dracolich has the strange ability to inhabit the body of any reptilian
corpse upon death though they are at their most powerful when inhabiting the
corpse of a dragon. When killed in its corporeal body the dracolich doesn't
"die". Its spirit flees and hides in the phylactery, awaiting another suitable
body to animate and inhabit. Like other types of lich a dracolich is only
truly annihilated when its phylactery is destroyed.

An animated dog skeleton is here standing silently.
~
Skeletons are undead animated corpses similar to zombies but are completely
devoid of flesh and do not feed on the living. They can be made from virtually
any solid creature and as such their size and power varies widely. In addition
to the basic humanoid skeleton there are also skeletons created from wolves,
trolls, ettins and even giants. Animated skeletons are immune to mind
affecting spells; they cannot be rendered unconscious and cannot tire. Clerics
often have the ability to repel or destroy undead creatures, of which animated
skeletons are usually the weakest of such adversaries.

the ghoul~
A ghoul is here, contemplating your existance.
~
Ghouls are humanoid undead that feed on the flesh of corpses. They lair within
ancient crypts or hide in graveyards where food is plentiful. Whenever
possible a ghoul will attack a living target as a rare opportunity to have
fresh meat.
 
A ghoul appears to be an emaciated humanoid creature with putrid grey skin.
It's teeth have worn away into fangs and it has a long-lashing tongue. The
fingers and toes of a ghoul end in sharp claws, blackened from constantly
digging up grave dirt.
 
People rightfully fear ghouls and their corpse-eating ways. The bite of a
ghoul inflicts a terrible disease. Any who die from the illness arises as a
ghoul soon afterward. The touch of a ghoul carries a necromantic power that
paralyzes those whom it touches.

A zombie is an undead creature usually created by the re-animation of a
corpse. Unlike animated skeletons zombies still retain some flesh on their
bodies and give off a horrid, rank smell. They are almost mindless but can be
given simple commands such as "kill anyone who opens the treasure chest."
Virtually any solid creature can be turned into a zombie; in addition to
humanoids troglodytes, minotaurs, and even beholders can turned into zombies.

A ju-ju zombie is an undead creature created with a singular purpose by dark
voodoo magic from a fresh humanoid corpse. Depending on the age of the ju-ju
zombie it can be freshly rotted or almost mummified in appearance. The ju-ju
zombie variation of the zombie is quite a bit more powerful than a run of the
mill zombie. A ju-ju zombie will always pursue and attempt to complete what
ever purpose it was assigned and bound to upon creation. Upon completing said
purpose it will immediately crumble into dust.

a haunt~
A haunt is here haunting you in a spooky manner.
~
A haunt is the spirit of a deceased humanoid. This type of undead is
incorporeal in nature and only vulnerable to conventional weapons on the
Ethereal Plane. The haunt exists on two planes, the material and the Astral
Plane. It's connection to the material plane is severed when you destroy it,
but in a few days the haunt will usually come back. Haunts are a repetitive
nusiance for those who live in it's chosen or assigned area.
 
A haunt can also be under the control of wizards, sorcerers, liches, etc...
In this case the haunt is finally put to rest when destroyed on material plane
or it's master is dead. This is usually uncommon though, because to raise a
haunt it requires more magic than raising a regular undead.

A mummy is here shuffling about and moaning softly in anger.
~
A mummy is an undead creature that has been created from a preserved corpse.
These horrid creatures are often marked with symbols of the gods. While other
undead often stink of carrion the herbs and powders used to create a mummy
give off a sharp, pungent spice odor. Mummies often cause immense fear in the
living and any creature they touch is affected by it's rotting disease often
called mummy rot. Inhabiting great tombs or temple complexes they maintain a
timeless vigil over their master's treasure.
 
A mummy moves with a slow, shambling gait and groans with the weight of the
ages when it pursues and attacks intruders. Being magically created the mummy
will fight to the death every time.

A Banshee is a female phantom that embodies the essence of hideousness.
Banshees are the spirits of strongwilled, selfish humanoids. They are undead
creatures who delights in bringing death to any living creature.

of time the image of the banshee tends to become blurred and indistinct but
still recognizable as humanoid. A banshee is incorporeal having no physical
body or form. The banshee is infamous for it's wailing scream that is said to
deplete the life of creatures by accelerating their aging process.

A vampire is an undead creature. A humanoid or monstrous humanoid can become a
vampire and looks as it did in life but with paler skin, haunting red eyes and
a feral cast to its features. A new vampire is created when another vampire
drains the life out of a living creature or when a living creature is killed
by its Energy Drain. Vampires are drawn to feed on the blood of the living and
can only survive on blood, obtaining it in any way they possibly can. They do
not cast shadows, nor do they possess a reflection.

A death knight is a mighty undead warrior, created by gods of death, evil
deities, demon lords or other malevolent forces. These horrible champions of
evil are most commonly raised from the ranks of blackguards, fighters, rangers
and barbarians. A paladin who falls from grace near the moment of death may
also become a death knight.
 
A death knight's physical form is that of its decayed body, with a blackened
skull, patches of rotting flesh and two pinpoints of eerie light in the eye
sockets. Its voice is chilling, seeming to echo from deep within. Once
powerful people in life, death knights often prefer to wear expensive or magic
clothing and armor, along with flowing capes to mark them as figures of
importance.

A lich is standing here silent and immobile, it's eyes simmering with red light.
~
Liches are aform of undead spellcaster of great power, usually wizards, but
they can also be sorcerers or clerics. They are feared by mortal beings for
their malignant magic, their intelligence and their willingness to embrace
undeath for a chance to live forever (or rather, exist forever). Because
liches have eternal longevity they often use this time to form schemes that
take decades to develope, sometimes preferring to outlive a foe instead of
confronting it, and as such most liches live in secluded areas.

Liches are generally gaunt and skeletal with withered flesh stretched tight
across horribly visible bones, but can vary greatly in appearance depending
on their age (some appear as skeletons dressed in regal finery, yet others may
appear to be nothing more than lepers). Bright pinpoints of crimson light burn
in the empty sockets of those whose eyes have been destroyed or otherwise lost
or are so old they have simply rotted away. They are often clad in dark,
tattered robes. When moving they seem to glide as if floating on water.
 
Liches often do not have lips or the necessary organs to produce natural
speech, but they have the ability to project speech from their mouths
magically, moving the jaw (if present) to aid the illusion.

The orc~
An orc stands here, smelling very bad.
~
Orcs vary in appearance, based on region and subrace, but all share certain
physical qualities. Orcs of all kinds usually have grayish skin, coarse hair,
stooped postures, low foreheads, and porcine faces that feature lower canines
that resemble boar tusks. Many also have wolf-like ears that are pointed on
the ends, similar to elves. Orcs are roughly the same size as humans.
 
Orcs breed fast and live short lives compared with most other races. They are
considered adults anywhere between 11 and 14 years of age; they are considered
middle-aged at seventeen, old at twenty three, and venerable at thirty five
years of age. The average orc seldom lives longer than 40 years, even if it
manages to avoid violent death. It is unheard of for an orc to live longer
than forty five years without magical aid.

A sahuagin is swimming about here looking for an esape route.
~
Sahuagin are usually green skinned, darker on the back and lighter on the
belly. Many have dark stripes, bands, or spots, but these tend to fade with
age. An adult male sahuagin stands roughly 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and weighs
about 200 pounds (91 kg). Sahuagin are highly fish-like, with webbed feet and
hands, gills, and a finned tail.
 
About one in every 216 hatchlings possesses four functional arms. While
Sahuagin usually kill off defective hatchlings they allow these to live.

A very large dragon {yt{Yu{gr{Yt{gl{ye{x is floating stone still in the water here.
~
Dragon turtles are aquatic creatures that are related to dragons. While they
cannot fly, they are adept swimmers and many consider them to be the most
powerful non-dragons, and one of the most dangerous things in the ocean, after
Krakens. Many sailors avoid the territories of dragon turtles or attempt to
placate the creatures with treasure.
 
Dragon turtles appear to be huge sea turtles with long tails used to attain
great swimming speeds. Their bodies are protected with a heavy shell which
makes it impervious to most weapons. Dragon turtles are capable of expelling
a blast of scalding steam from their mouths. An adult dragon turtle can
measure from 20 to 30 feet from snout to tail, with a shell from 15 to 25 feet
in diameter, and can weigh 8,000 to 32,000 pounds.

Rocs are gargantuan birds, an eagle-like animal. They inhabit the highest
mountains in warm regions. They prey upon large creatures such as cattle,
horses, and elephants. The roc swoops down upon prey, seizes it in its
powerful talons, and carries it off to its lair. If the creature resists, the
roc will strike it with its beak. The lair of a roc will be a vast nest of
trees, branches, and the like. There its treasure will be strewn about, for
the creature does not value suchit is the residue of its victims. Rocs are
occasionally tamed and used by giants.

A legendary griffon is flying through the air here.
~
A griffon is an intelligent beast with the body of a lion and the wings,
forelegs and head of an eagle.[1] In the wild they live in open caverns set in
hills and mountain regions. When acquainted with humans, they are usually
stabled in airy, doorless stone halls, vaguely resembling their lairs.
 
Griffons usually make their homes in high places in the mountains. They do
this so that their young can be safe from those who would seek to steal them
and use them as mounts. Due to the fact that these beasts are intelligent,
using a griffon as a mount is seen as a form of slavery in some locations.

Storm giants stand over twenty feet tall and can weigh around twelve thousand
pounds. They tend to wear fine tunics and belted sandals. When they enter
battle, storm giants don bronze breastplates and Corinthian helmets.
 
Storm giants are the most powerful of giant-kin; their power is near that of
the ancient titans. Much like a violent storm, a storm giant is prone to
sudden bouts of violence and mood swings. They are brutal and dangerous foes
who wield the power of weather and can hurl lightning with a gesture.
 
Storm giants make their homes on isolated islands or along coastal regions of
the world. Despite their temperamental behavior these beings are the most
civilized of the giant races. They will even engage in trade with communities
of small folk.

mining. Kobolds are distantly related to dragons and urds and are often found
serving the former as minions.
 
Kobolds are a bipedal form of reptile. A kobold stands between 2' and 2'6"
(60cm  75cm) tall, weighing 35 to 45 pounds (16  20kg). They have scaly
reptilian skin between reddish brown and black in color, with burnt orange
to red eyes. Their legs are sinewy and double-jointed. They have long, clawed
fingers and a jaw like a crocodile. Small white or tan horns protrude from
their head, and they have rat-like tails. Kobolds smell of wet dog and
stagnant water. They like to wear red or orange garments, which are usually
ragged.

A goblin stand here before you.

Goblins are small goblinoids that many consider little more than a nuisance.
They have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, and small, sharp fangs. Their
foreheads slope back, and their eyes vary in color from red to yellow. Their
skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red;
usually all members of the same tribe share the same colored skin, though they
also come in shades of green. Goblins are typically found in dark leathers
soiled by poor hygiene and colored in a similar range of tones to their skin.
Goblins usually stand between 3'4" and 3'8" and weigh about 40 to 55 pounds
on average. Goblins breed extremely rapidly compared with many other races,
accounting for their large population.

hobgoblin~
a hobgoblin~
A hobgoblin is standing here looking very irritated.
~
By and large hobgoblins, like their kin, are considered evil creatures and
often meet this expectation. Goblinoid society is cruel and harsh, but some
individuals yet escape it to carry on lives of virtue, though fewer such
individuals are hobgoblins than true goblins. Those few who do take this risk
and succeed often meet cautious praise and acceptance from outsiders. 
 
Those that do are, however, continuously plagued by their nature. Though
hobgoblins are not necessarily evil they are prone to violence and hot tempers
and find it difficult to be truly altruistic. When provoked, which is often
easy, hobgoblins are vindictive creatures who take glee in causing pain to
those that injured them. Those hobgoblins who overcome this nature often do
so because of the rewards they find in serving good, rather than evil.

A large ettin is here, rage induced spittle dripping from his lips.

Ettin are giant like creatures with two heads, each of which is capable of
independent thought and each controlling one arm. The left head directs the
left arm and right head directs the right arm. They are vicious and
unpredictable scavengers that stalk the night. Their two heads make them
exceptionally sharp-eyed and alert.
 
An ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it so grimy and
dirty that their skin resembles thick grey hide. Adult ettins are about 13
feet tall, and weigh about 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years. Ettins
talk among themselves without difficulty, despite their low inteligence, and
a lone Ettin often whiles away the hours chatting to itself.

Hill giants are short and stocky in comparison to other giants. They are

because of their shorter limbs. Hill giants are not particularly intelligent
and usually live in tribal societies.

A green and spindly limbed troll stands here before you.
~
Trolls are a massive, predatory species of giant-kin and they are considered
to be "stupid bastards" by other species of giants except for ogres who are
generally treated about the same. The most distinctive feature of trolls is
their ability to regenerate. If any part of a troll's body is cut off, it will
grow back after a while and the felled limb has a chance to evolve into an
entirely new troll. The only things that can stop this are fire and acid, both
of which trolls fear greatly.
 
Trolls initially seem to be somewhat shorter, due to their sagging shoulders
and tendency to hunch forward. They walk with an uneven gait, and their arms
dangle and drag the ground when running. Despite this apparent awkwardness
trolls are quite agile.

Gnolls are extremely tall, the average member of the race standing anywhere
between seven and nine feet tall but are relatively lean for their height. In
part because of their height and lean musculature gnolls are very quick
compared with many other races such as humans. Gnoll skin is a greenish-gray,
and their furry hide is light or dark brown marked sometimes with spots or
stripes. Many gnolls also have a dirty yellow to reddish gray crest like mane
that stands on end when a gnoll is angry.
 
It is believed by some that gnolls have traces of demonic blood, which may be
evidenced by unusual features found amongst some of the gnoll bloodlines.
These anamolies can include include talons, gleaming red eyes or black fur
with fiery orange spots.

Centaurs generally live in tribal hunter-gatherer societies. They have good
relations with elves, being as they are both creatures of the forest. They
generally despise humans and dwarves but aren't actively hostile to them.
Centaur warriors are famous for their long bow and swordmanship skills.

A bugbear is a massive humanoid distantly related to, but larger and stronger
than, goblins and hobgoblins. Like many goblinoids bugbears speak goblin. They
are one of the only goblinoids to be covered in fur.
 
Bugbears resemble hairy, feral goblins standing approximately seven feet tall.
They take their name from their noses and claws, which are similar to those of
bears. Their claws are not long and sharp enough to be used as weapons so
bugbears often armor and arm themselves with a variety of purloined gear. Most
often, this gear is second-rate and in poor repair. Many scholars believe that
bugbears and goblins were both bred by the hobgoblins as slave races, with
bugbears intended to serve as elite soldiers.

stone clubs. Stone giants have an excellent sense of smell and also possess

giants can weight up to seven thousand pounds, (3175kg). They prefer to live
in hot environments like volcanic areas either in caverns or castles and exist
in societies often led by a king or a queen. Their clothing is usually flame
coloured or black and their armors are crafted from the finest steel. Fire
Giants will use magically flaming weapons if possible and attack with rocks
heated in fire or lava. They favour the taking of captives and will often
extort payment from the lesser creatures in surrounding areas in exchange for
"protection."

A yochlol demon is here shivering and writhing it's tentacles in fury.
~
A yochlol is a type of lesser demon who act as "handmaidens" to Lolth, the
drow goddess of chaos. Their natural home is the Demonweb Pits. Only the
Queen of Spider's high priestesses are told how to summon a yochlol and they
are only supposed to be called upon in dire need or to witness sacrifices in
the name of their dark goddess.
 
In their natural form they appear as tentacled blobs of melted wax and
continually emit a foul stench. They also have the power to change their
shapes usually to a comely drow female, (although other elves and humans are
possible for them), or to a large spider, (usually a black widow). They can
also change themselves into a gaseous form, allowing their unknowing victims
to inhale them, and then suffocating them.
 
Lloth created the Yochlol from succubi she captured from Abyssal layers. She
has never revealed what she does to transform the succubi into yochlols but
when the process is complete, the yochlol remembers nothing of it's former
life and is completely loyal to her new mistress.

A drop dead gorgeous succubus demon is here licking her lips at your approach.

Of the many demons that exist in the universe, the succubus is the one most
often encountered in the mortal world. This is due to her extraordinary beauty
and carnal desires; traits that attract mortal spellcasters to summon the
demoness forth to use for their own debased desire. Succubi delight in causing
suffering by manipulating the desires of mortals and tempting them into
depraved acts that they would normally avoid. This strife often causes the
destruction of long-term relationships and sows distrust between life long
friends and lovers. Succubi are not warriors. Their method of causing
destruction is slow and manipulative when compared to other demons. These
beautiful fiends will often go to great lengths to avoid battle, using their
many demonic powers to assume mortal guises and manipulate others around them
to fight in their stead.

An illithid is here staring at you with hate filled eyes.
~
The illithid, also called the mind-flayer, is an evil and sadistic being
humanoid in appearance but with a four tentacled octopus like head. These
beings are feared throughout the Underdark for their telepathic abilities and
usually are not without two or more slaves, mentally bound, to each individual
illithid. Although they cooperate to achieve a goal they will back away from
any venture at the first sign that it's not profitable. They are capable of
speech but prefer telepathic communication and will attempt to mentally
dominate any non-slave, non-illithid they meet. Some have theorized that
illithids are aliens from the future that have come back in time to save their
species from extinction. Another tale is that they are cursed inbred mutant
offspring of humans from a distant world. However, more convincing evidence
points to a more sinister origin. They feed on the brains of sentient
creatures and are thus feared. Their natural psionic abilities also make them
respected in the eyes of the drow, beholders, duergar and the other dominant
races of the Underdark and Outer Planes.

Babaus usually serve as a spy or assassin to more powerful demons of the Abyss
or sometimes to spellcasters on the material plane. Babaus strike with sudden
ferocity after forming careful, devious plans. Most demon lords have at least
several babaus as minions. Babaus usually try to summon another Babau before
battle so they can both lay plans together using their telepathy and strike
from either side of the opponent to get a flanking attack.
 
Babaus stand about eight feet tall and resemble a gaunt humanoid covered in
black leathery skin with pointed ears and a long curved horn jutting out of
the back of their heads. They also are covered by a red protective slimy jelly
that damages anything it touches like acid.

a maelephant demon~
A massive maelephant demon is standing here, it's tusks gleaming in the light.
~
The maelephant is a denizen of the Nine Hells and a powerful guardian used to
protect the treasures of greater fiends and powerful archmages. It is humanoid
in shape, standing approximately twenty feet tall and weighing thousands of
pounds. Its oversized hands are tipped with vicious claws and its head is just
like that of a small elephant. Generally they are bound into service but some
have escaped and can be found roaming the outer planes following their natural
instinct to guard and protect something. A maelephant will fight to the death
to protect its territory or its charge but will not usually pursue intruders.

an angel~
An angel is sitting here with it's wings wrapped around itself.
~
Angels, also known as the Aasimon, are celestial immortals of varying humanoid
forms that hail from any of the Celestial Planes or the Astral Sea. In the
Dawn War, angels served deities as soldiers, though they are not necessarily
in the service of the gods anymore. Angels are ancient enemies of elementals
as well as all manner of fiends.
 
Angels, who range from human-like to ogre-like in size, are not so much
physical beings as energy given form. Made both from the essence of the Astral
Sea and that of the Celestial Planes angels are basically the energy of both
given form. This form is vaguely humanoid, with varying degrees of similarity
to mortals. Most angels have only the most basic masculine or feminine
features. Angels all exhibit wings of some form, which they can use to fly or
otherwise utilize during battle.

~
A bebilith is a massive demonic spider the size of an elephant. They delight
in causing suffering and pain in others, but especially so in demons whom they
hunt for food. The bebilith seem to be some form of supernatural demon
predators.
 
Bebiliths have spider-shaped bodies, with long fore-legs ending in razor-sharp
claws. These claws are used to penetrate and rip armor plating from the
bebiliths foes. Just as with spiders, bebiliths have a lethal bite, but
rather than a venom, (to which demons are immune), they inject a vile fluid
that causes an accelerated rotting of the flesh.

Felldrakes are small, wingless dragons that are descendants of Draconic Blood

felldrakes trace their origin back to Elves. After a particularly nasty demonic
invasion these particular elves captured a few evil dragons and magically
altered them into the beast now known as the Felldrake to aid them in their
battle. There are many variations of the fell drake today; the crested
felldrake, the horned felldrake, the spiked felldrake, the spitting felldrake,
and many more.

{yBr{Yo{ynz{Ye{x {Cdragons are one of the most powerful of the metallic dragons. They{x
{Cenjoy observing and interacting with lesser creatures, most especially humans.{x
{CThey will often go out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from{x

{CPhysically the {ybr{Yo{ynz{Ye{x {Cdragon is quite fierce in appearance, despite its good{x
{Cnature. While most of its body is a reflective {ybr{Yo{ynz{Ye{x {Ccolor the wings are{x
{Coften tipped with green. The dragon has three large horns protruding from{x
{Ceach cheek that point back towards the tail. The tips of these horns are{x
{Cblack and very sharp and are utilized by the dragon for grooming. The tongue{x
{Cis purple-gray, long and pointed but not forked. A large frill runs down the{x
{Cupper part of its neck. These dragons possess the ability to alter their form,{x
{Cassuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose.{x
 
{yBr{Yo{ynz{Ye{x {Cdragons prefer physical combat but do have two breath weapons at their{x

{Cdragon, a life spent wresting the secrets from ancient ruins and restoring{x
{Cthose ruins to their former glory is a life well spent. Woe to anyone that{x

{RC{yo{Yp{yp{Ye{rr{x {Cdragons are one of the weakest of the metallic dragons. They are born{x

a {yb{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x dragon~
A {yb{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x dragon is here looking a bit forlorn and unhappy.
~
{yB{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x {Cdragons are the least power of the metallic dragons but one of the most
benign of all dragon species. They love to converse with lesser races,
collecting and trading wonderous tales of adventure and excitement. It is not
unusual for a brass dragon to be fluent in an amazing number of languages.
 
Physically the {yb{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x {Cdragon is highly distinctive. From below its outstretched
wings form a triangular shape as they are attached to its body all the way to
the tip of its tail. The wings are longest at the shoulder and taper gently as
they reach the tail. Their scales seem to radiate heat and light. As their
name implies, {yb{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x {Cdragons tend to have brass-colored scales. Their scales
are a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass in appearance
as they age. The shape of the head is quite unusual as it includes a large,
curved plate that extends from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and
curves upwards into two points. They have two sharp horns on the chin which
become steadily pointier as the dragon ages.
 
{yB{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x {Cdragons have two separate breath weapons. The first is a narrow line of
fire and the second is a cloud of gas that puts it's victims into an instant
slumber.{x

Geigenbauer~
A disheveled looking man swathed in layers of robes is lost in thought here.
~
Geigenbauer, the infamous Mad Enchanter, is a middle aged man swathed in a
tangle of robes. His hair is long, white and tangled in every way imaginable.
Once Geigenbauer was the most prominent researcher in the field of dragons,
alchemy and enchantment who was often a guest teacher within the Tower of
High Sorcery. However, his unyielding obession with dragons consumed his life
and led him down the road to obscurity. Nobody is really sure what became of
him, but here he stands before you now.
 
Some of the finest potion recipes and magical enchantment processes known to
to the world were pioneered and spearheaded by Geigenbauer himself. Some of
the world's most powerful dragon themed artifacts where thought up and created
by Geigenbauer himself. One might wonder if he's still in posession of or 
possibly capable of producing such items of power.

Captain's Log Book
 
Entry XII.
  Patrons have complained that a hermit like old man has been harassing them
on the trails near the Museum. Accounts all state that he has spoken of the
Museum's dragon exhibits and magical items of power. There was also some
metion of an orb of some type or another. I have dispatched a small group of
guards to scout the areas near the road's and trails leading to the Museum.
 
Entry XXVI.
  My guards were unable to locate the hermit museum patrons have been report-
ing as harrassing them so I ventured into the hills myself. I did come across
this strange old man and was able to briefly speak with him. He refused to
provide me with any information regarding his intent and instead spoke to me
of the powers waiting to be harnessed from the dragons we have on display. I
get the feeling that this old man is more than he appears and that something
strange is afoot. After a brief conversation I decided to try and apprehend
the loiterer but he vanished in the blink of an eye. I suspect he is some
sort of wizard or sorcerer.
 
Entry XXXVIII.
  While wandering the halls of the museum I caught a glimpse of the strange
hermit that's been wandering our hills on the Dragon Exhibit Floor. He was
holding a strange glowing object in his hand. I pursued him down a hallway
but as I turned the corner he was no longer in sight. Not really expecting to
find him I searched every floor of the museum to no avail. I've notified the
museum's master hunter and tracker Lord Tennyson. There have been additional
complaints of harrassment by the hermit from our patrons. So far as I can
tell no harm has come from any of this but I suspect that there is more to
this than I can readily see.
 
Entry XLVI.
  The museum curator called a meeting with myself and Lord Tennyson today.
He is not pleased with the activities of the hermit in the hills and has
informed us that he is a mad wizard formerly of the Tower of High Sorcery in
New Thalos. He warns us that the man is very dangerous and highly volatile.
Apparently he was released from a teaching position within the tower itself
when he developed an unhealthy obession with hunting dragons and infusing
their power into magical objects. We may have to seek outside aid in appreh-
-ending this man as I think he is way to crafty and powerful to be captured
by the likes of Lord Tennyson or myself.
 
Entry LVII.
  Today one of our lesser dragon-kin was discovered slain within it's exhibit.
Lord Tennyson surveyed the area and surmised that a small battle of some sort
had occured. Troubled by this event I ventured into the hills where I encoun-
-tered the hermit of the hills again. I informed him that the Museum was not
happy with his presence and that he needed to leave the grounds immediately.
The old man cackled to himself madly. I drew my sword and advanced upon him
but when I was within a few feet of him he looked me in the eye and smiled
briefly before dissolving into smoke and blowing away in the wind. This is
most definately a problem that we cannot handle on our own.

{Y[ {CGlabrezu Exhibit {Y]{x~
Glabrezu are one of the most powerful demons. A glabrezu tempts its victims
into ruin by luring them with power or wealth. Their imposing stature radiates
authority and control, which they use to sway mortals into accepting their
gifts...for a price. They use lies and deception to destroy the lives of all
whom these demons meet.
 
This demon's broad, muscular body is as large as a giant, with two pairs of
arms; one is humanoid ending in hands, while the others are monstrous ending
in a pair of crab-like pincers. Its caninelike head is horned with a muzzle
full of sharp teeth. A glabrezu towers in height at approximately fifteen feet
tall and looks to weigh as much as a building.

thick ribbons of the strange material as well. How exactly you got here and
how exactly you are going to get out are questionable at this point.
